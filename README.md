# Potato-Phytophthora-Spatiotemporal-Transcriptome

We report a comprehensive atlas of spatiotemporal transcriptomes in potato leaves inoculated with Phytophthora infestans at single-cell resolution. By utilizing spatiotemporal atlas, we explore the immune repose at single-cell levels and illustrate the characteristics of cell populations in different immune states and dynamic responses within host microenvironment. This will significantly advance our understanding of the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of plant-pathogen interactions, thereby providing novel strategies for developing disease-resistant crops.
